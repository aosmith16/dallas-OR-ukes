**The group does not currently have a play list.  Bring at least one song that you want to lead during the group.**  

We always have time for additional songs, so bring something you are working on to share.  If you are looking for songs with simpler chords, download a list of 2, 3, or 4 chord songs from the books [here](/tabs/songs_with_2-3-4_chords.xlsx).
