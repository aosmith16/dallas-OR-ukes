title: About the Dallas (Oregon!) Ukulele group
---

The Dallas (Oregon!) Ukulele group was started by the [Ukulele Fans of Oregon](http://www.ukulelefansoforegon.com/) (UFO) but has since become an independent group operating under the UFO umbrella.

The group meets on the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of every month from 5:15 PM to 6:45 PM at the [Dallas Public Library](https://www.ci.dallas.or.us/102/Library).  All ages and skill levels are welcome.  Three ukuleles are available for check-out from the library if you don't have one of your own yet and want to try one out.

We play songs from tabs and out of two ukulele books, the [Daily Ukulele](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Ukulele-Better-Living-Songbooks-ebook/dp/B00DB2GL2A) and the [Daily Ukulele - Leap Year Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Ukulele-Better-Living-Songbooks/dp/1458482685/ref=tmm_other_meta_binding_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), aka the <span style="color:goldenrod">Yellow Daily Ukulele</span> and the <span style="color:royalblue">Blue Daily Ukulele</span>, respectively.  If you don't have these books folks are generally happy to share.

All ages are welcome.  When our younger members come we often start the session singing children's songs out of the Yellow Daily Ukulele and then move on to our standard playlist.
